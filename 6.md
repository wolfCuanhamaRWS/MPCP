__Question 6-__
 
 a) `LSL x10, x12, #8` 
 
 We may use `UBFIZ` _(unsignal bit field insert in zero)_ as alternative:  
   
 `UBFIZ x10, x12, #8, #56`  
   
 b) `ASR x10, x12, #8`  
   
 We may use `SBFX`_(signal bit field extract)_ as alternative:   
   
`SBFX x10, x12, #8, #56`

c) `ROR w13, w14, #3` this is the instruction rotate right  
  
```
ubfiz w13, w14, #3, #29
bfi w13, w14, #3, #29
```
